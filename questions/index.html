     <h2>There are several types of selectors in CSS</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> Element selector: Selects elements by their tag name, such as p, h1, img, etc.</li>
                <li>Class selector: Selects elements by their class attribute using the dot notation, such as .my-class.
                </li>
                <li>ID selector: Selects elements by their ID attribute using the hash notation, such as #my-id.</li>
                <li>Attribute selector: Selects elements by their attributes, such as [type="text"], which selects all input elements with a type of "text".</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <p>vh and vw are CSS units that stand for viewport height and viewport width, respectively. They are used to size elements relative to the dimensions of the browser viewport, which is the visible portion of the browser window.
            </p>
           <ul>
            <li>1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.</li>
            <li>1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>For example, if you set an element's height to 50vh, it will take up 50% of the height of the viewport. Similarly, if you set an element's width to 25vw, it will take up 25% of the width of the viewport.
            Viewport units are useful for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios, as they scale proportionally with the viewport dimensions.</p>

            <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
            <p>    inline elements: These elements flow along with the text and other inline elements. They do not create line breaks and are sized based on their content. Examples of inline elements include a, span, and img.</p>
            <h3>Inline-Block Elements</h3>
            <p> inline-block elements: These elements are similar to inline elements, but they can be sized using width, height, padding, and margins. They do not create line breaks and can be positioned relative to their parent element. Examples of inline-block elements include button, input, and select.</p>
             <h3>Block Elements</h3>
             <p> block elements: These elements take up the full width of their parent element by default, and they create line breaks before and after themselves. They can be sized using width, height, padding, and margins, and can be positioned absolutely or relatively. Examples of block elements include div, h1, p, and ul.</p>
              <h3>N.B</h3>
              <p>In summary, inline elements flow with the text and do not create line breaks, inline-block elements flow with the text but can be sized and positioned, and block elements take up the full width of their parent and create line breaks before and after themselves</p>

                    In CSS, pseudo-classes are keywords that are used to define a special state of an element. They are used to select and style an element based on its current state or context, such as when it is being hovered over or clicked on, or when it is the first child or last child of its parent.</p>
                <p>Some common examples of pseudo-classes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>   :hover: Selects an element when the user hovers over it with the mouse.</li>
                    <li> :active: Selects an element when it is being clicked or tapped.</li>
                    <li> :focus: Selects an element when it has focus, such as when it is selected by tabbing through the page.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>this is a hover example</h2>

                    <p> Absolute units: These units are fixed and do not change based on the size of the viewport or the device. Examples include px (pixels), in (inches), cm (centimeters), and mm (millimeters).

                        Relative units: These units are based on the size of other elements or the viewport, and they can adapt to different devices and screen sizes. Examples include em, rem, %, vw (viewport width), and vh (viewport height).
                    
                        Font-relative units: These units are based on the size of the font, and they are typically used for text-related properties. Examples include ex (x-height of the font) and ch (width of the "0" character in the font).</p>

                        content-box (default): In this mode, the width and height of the element are calculated based on the content area only, and any padding or borders are added to the outside of the element. This means that if you add padding or a border to the element, it will increase the total width and height of the element.
                    
                        border-box: In this mode, the width and height of the element are calculated based on the content area, padding, and border together. This means that the total width and height of the element are fixed, and adding padding or a border to the element will not increase its size.</p>

                    <p>In CSS3, the opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element. It is a value between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque), with decimal values allowed for partial transparency.
